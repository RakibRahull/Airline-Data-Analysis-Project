•  Top Airline Performance: Which of the Top 10 Airlines (by flights) generated the highest total revenue and the highest average revenue per flight?
•  Pricing Strategy: How does the Avg Ticket Price of the Top-Priced Airline (Thai Airways) compare to the Lowest-Priced Airline (Qatar Airways), and what is the difference in their respective Total Flights?
•  Operational Efficiency (Stopovers): What percentage of flights are Direct (Non-stop), and how does the revenue generated by Direct flights compare to flights with 1 or 2 Stops?
•  Peak Activity Day/Month: Which Month and Weekday combination exhibits the highest volume of Total Flights, indicating peak operational demand?
•  Airport Traffic: How does the flight volume at the Top Airport (Shah Amanat International Airport) compare to the average flight volume of the next five busiest airports?
•  Booking Behavior: What is the average Booking Lead Time (45 days) for the airline generating the most revenue compared to the airline generating the least revenue?
•  Revenue Structure: What is the average percentage of Total Tax & Surcharge relative to the Total Revenue across all flights?
•  Forecasting Accuracy: How does the actual flight volume trend for late 2025/early 2026 compare against the initial Forecast shown in the "Total Flights by Start of the Month" chart?
