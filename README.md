4. Operational Efficiency (Stopovers): What percentage of flights are Direct (Non-stop), and how does the revenue generated by Direct flights compare to flights with 1 or 2 Stops?
5. Peak Activity Day/Month: Which Month and Weekday combination exhibits the highest volume of Total Flights, indicating peak operational demand?
6. Airport Traffic: How does the flight volume at the Top Airport (Shah Amanat International Airport) compare to the average flight volume of the next five busiest airports?
7. Booking Behavior: What is the average Booking Lead Time (45 days) for the airline generating the most revenue compared to the airline generating the least revenue?
8. Revenue Structure: What is the average percentage of Total Tax & Surcharge relative to the Total Revenue across all flights?
9. Forecasting Accuracy: How does the actual flight volume trend for late 2025/early 2026 compare against the initial Forecast shown in the "Total Flights by Start of the Month" chart?
