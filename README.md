# Airline-Data-Analysis-Project (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)
## Project Objective
To analyze 24 Airlines' flight data from January 2025 to March 2026, delivering actionable, data-driven insights to management that optimize operational efficiency, enhance revenue streams, and inform strategic growth initiatives.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/RakibRahull/Airline-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Flight_Price_Dataset_of_Bangladesh.xlsx">Flight_Price_Dataset_of_Bangladesh</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
1. Revenue Performance: What is the Month-over-Month (MoM) growth/decline in Total Revenue and Total Flights from January 2025 to March 2026?
2. Top Airline Performance: Which of the Top 10 Airlines (by flights) generated the highest total revenue and the highest average revenue per flight?
3. Pricing Strategy: How does the Avg Ticket Price of the Top-Priced Airline (Thai Airways) compare to the Lowest-Priced Airline (Qatar Airways), and what is the difference in their respective Total Flights?
4. Operational Efficiency (Stopovers): What percentage of flights are Direct (Non-stop), and how does the revenue generated by Direct flights compare to flights with 1 or 2 Stops?
5. Peak Activity Day/Month: Which Month and Weekday combination exhibits the highest volume of Total Flights, indicating peak operational demand?
6. Airport Traffic: How does the flight volume at the Top Airport (Shah Amanat International Airport) compare to the average flight volume of the next five busiest airports?
7. Booking Behavior: What is the average Booking Lead Time (45 days) for the airline generating the most revenue compared to the airline generating the least revenue?
8. Revenue Structure: What is the average percentage of Total Tax & Surcharge relative to the Total Revenue across all flights?
9. Forecasting Accuracy: How does the actual flight volume trend for late 2025/early 2026 compare against the initial Forecast shown in the "Total Flights by Start of the Month" chart?
10. Class Performance: What is the distribution of Total Flights and Total Revenue across the three main classes: Business, Economy, and First Class? (Assuming the buttons represent filters for these classes).

## Process
The analysis began with meticulous data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to ensure data integrity. Key performance indicators were then calculated precisely with DAX measures before being visualized across various interactive charts. Finally, these elements were compiled into a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with dynamic slicers, enabling flexible and detailed data-driven analysis for management.

## Project Insights
1. Revenue Concentration: The Top 10 Airlines (led by US-Bangla Airlines and Emirates) collectively generate a disproportionately high share of the total revenue, indicating a market concentration where revenue optimization efforts should be focused.
2. Operational Preference & Efficiency: Direct (Non-stop) flights constitute the highest volume of total flights, suggesting a strong passenger preference for speed and convenience, which is critical for maximizing aircraft utilization and route scheduling.
3. Pricing Disparity: There is a significant competitive gap between the Highest-Priced Airline (Thai Airways) and the Lowest-Priced Airline (Qatar Airways), presenting opportunities for price-sensitive marketing or premium service differentiation.
4. Peak Demand Period: The dashboard clearly identifies Sundays and the start of the months (e.g., January/March 2026) as peak periods for flight volume, requiring proactive capacity management and resource allocation at the busiest hub, Shah Amanat International Airport.
5. Booking Behavior: The Average Booking Lead Time of 45 days provides a crucial window for dynamic pricing and inventory management strategies, allowing the airline to optimize yield based on demand signals well in advance of the flight date.
## Final Conclusion:
Based on the strategic analysis of the 24 airlines' operational and financial data from January 2025 to March 2026, a clear pathway for revenue optimization and operational efficiency has been established.
The analysis confirms that revenue is highly concentrated within the top-performing carriers (e.g., US-Bangla Airlines), and the preference for Direct flights dictates a focus on optimizing core, non-stop routes for maximum yield. Strategic efforts should be directed toward managing peak demand on Sundays and the start of the month at the busiest airport, requiring adaptive scheduling and resource deployment. Furthermore, the average 45-day booking lead time offers a critical window for implementing dynamic, competitive pricing strategies to capitalize on the identified disparity between high-priced and low-priced carriers, ensuring the airline maximizes profitability per available seat kilometer.
